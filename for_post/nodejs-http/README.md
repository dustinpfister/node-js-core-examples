## http

This is a collection of javaScript source code examples for [my blog post on the http module in nodejs](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2018/02/06/nodejs-http/). Like just about all my other blog posts on nodejs, and just about every other topic I write about the content of that post and these source code examples are all a work in progress. Every now and then I get around to doing some editing on that post as well as close to a thousand others at the time of this writing, so often a great deal of time might pass between additional edits of the content there.
